## Scenario
A property management company renting rooms and properties for short periods on various rental 
platforms needs to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar 
properties. With new data received in bulk every week; the model needs to be retrained with the 
same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.

In this project, I built such a pipeline.
